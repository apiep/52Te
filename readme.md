# 52Te

52Te is a split keyboard inspired by the NISSE keyboard created by Esrille.

The firmware is heavily based on Lily58 due to wiring and layout similarities.

Right now this is hand-wired with ProMicroSocket and BitBoard by swanmatch

May add a PCB for v2.0.

Plate and case files to come later.
